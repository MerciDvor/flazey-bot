# flazey-bot
Welcome! This repository holds the Discord bot for my Clash Royale Community! Using the Clash Royale API, Discord API, and some Node.js, I was able to create a bot that fetches
game data from the API with some commands. Below is the result of the `!commands` discord chat command. All other commands return in a similar structure (nice little embed, but 
with game data instead of a constant list of commands). <br /> <br />

UPDATE 9/7: Command on 2v2 glitch added and updated. `!glitch` discord command!

# To use this repository
Honestly, I have no idea. You can just try to clone this repository and if you have node.js/npm installed, you can use the `npm install` command to download all dependencies
necessary.
